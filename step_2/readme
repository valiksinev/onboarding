1. investigate sources of the hello_world smart-contract.
    useful links:
        https://solana.com/docs/core/accounts#rent
        https://solana.com/docs/core/pda
        https://solana.com/docs/core/cpi

2. build project using solana-tools:
    $ cd hello-world
    $ cargo build-sbf

3. run solana, airdrop funds, deploy hello-world contract
    $ solana program deploy target/deploy/hello_world.so

4. create program in Rust that creates and sends transactions to invoke hello_world contract:
    - create_account instruction
    - resize_account instruction:
        steps to reproduce:
        - call instruction create_account to create account with data.len ==0
        - call instruction resize to allocate account data
        - call instruction resize to deallocate account data


5. extend hello_world contract:
    - implement system_program::transfer instruction
        transfer funds to existent account, non-existent account

    - implement system_program::allocate instruction
        call it to allocate account space

    - implement system_instruction::assign instruction
        steps to test:
         - call transfer instruction to create new account with owner == SystemProgram::ID,
         - call instruction to assign owner to program_id

    - investigate following example which creates a non-existent account or allocates an existent account:
    https://github.com/solana-program/associated-token-account/blob/e320c11553bfedb7aa52d781ed4d672fa5d92657/program/src/tools/account.rs#L28

    To find out how the SystemProgram instructions work, you can use the link:

6. Understanding Solana authority rules.
    - create new solana accounts:
        solana-keygen new --no-bip39-passphrase --silent -o id1.json
        solana-keygen new --no-bip39-passphrase --silent -o id2.json

    - deploy hello_world.so to two different addresses:
        solana program deploy --program-id id1.json hello_world.so
        solana program deploy --program-id id2.json hello_world.so

    - call create_account instructions for each programs

    - try to call resize instruction of program_1 using account created by program_2.
        Transaction will fail.
        Reason: program_1 is able to modify only its own account.

    - try to call assign instruction of program_1 using account created by program_2.
        Transaction will fail.
        Reason : to allocate account, it is necessary to provide signature of this account:
        https://github.com/anza-xyz/solana-sdk/blob/9decd857f019cc4c8dd89f4b3811ea56b0ac5c8e/system-interface/src/instruction.rs#L624
        We are using program derived accounts (PDA) which were derived from progam_1, program_2.
        PDA doesn't have corresponding private keys. PDA uses the seed as authority (as signature).
        There are two reasons why transaction failed:
            1. program_1 can't provide seed of PDA that was derived from program_2
            2. program_1 is able to modify only its own accounts

     - implement instruction "transfer_from" which transfers funds from specified PDA account.
     Then:
        - create PDA account. Transfer funds to this account. You can do that using "solana" tool in terminal or by calling hello_world::transfer instruction.
        - call transfer_from instruction. Transaction will fail.
        Reason: The instruction SystemProgram::transfer is processed by SystemProgram.
        Each Solana program is able to modify only its ows accounts. PDA is owned by hello_world program.

     - modify the create_account instruction: instruction data should consists of instruction_id | owner | len
        Then:
            - create PDA with owner == SystemProgram::ID and data.len() != 0
            - transfer funds to this account
            - try to transfer funds from this account using "transfer_from" instruction
            Transaction will fail.
            Reason: Implementation of SystemProgram::transfer instruction raise error if "from" account has non-empty data:
